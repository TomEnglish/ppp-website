## FAQ CONTENT

### General Questions

**Q: What is contrast therapy?**
A: Contrast therapy alternates between hot (sauna) and cold (plunge) exposure. This hot-cold cycling boosts circulation, reduces inflammation, speeds recovery, and delivers a powerful mood and energy boost.

**Q: What temperature is the cold plunge?**
A: The Morozko maintains water between 32°F and 68°F. We typically set it to 38-42°F for optimal contrast therapy.

**Q: What temperature does the sauna reach?**
A: The Clearlight infrared sauna reaches up to 170°F with full spectrum infrared heat.

**Q: Is cold plunge therapy safe?**
A: Cold plunge therapy is generally safe for healthy adults. However, we recommend consulting your physician before use, especially if you have heart conditions, are pregnant, or have other health concerns. All users must sign a liability waiver.

**Q: What's the minimum age?**
A: Users must be 16 or older. Minors require parent/guardian consent.
